# Demo_Day
This was a project created during a Summer Program in 2020 that was supposed to act as a Protest Registry and Sign-up website to more easily allow individuals to organize effective protests. It was created over the course of week with 4 partenrs total and we presented this to the rest of the organization and our parents during the Demo-Day on the last day of the program.
